# Wine-Quality

In which dataset contains following Attributes:

7 - total sulfur dioxide

8 - density

9 - pH

10 - sulphates

11 - alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data):

12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)


Where we have to predict the Quality of on the above characteristics of wine.

So, I basically do EDA( Outlier Detection and Removal , Visualisation using Seaborn and matplotlib , and many more...)

And for Modeling part I used Random Forest where I got 88% effiency after using random forest

For further work I'm going to impliment more modelling algorithm like logistic regression , SVM
